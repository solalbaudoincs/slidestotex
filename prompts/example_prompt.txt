I want you to generate the LaTeX content of a given page, but only include everything that would appear inside the \begin{document} and \end{document} environment (do not include any header or preamble content).

When formatting the content, please follow these guidelines:

    Custom Environments:
    Use the following preset environments when applicable:
        Definition:
        \begin{definition}[definition title]
        definition content
        \end{definition}
        Proposition:
        \begin{proposition}[proposition title]
        proposition content
        \end{proposition}
        Theorem:
        \begin{theorem}[theorem title]
        theorem content
        \end{theorem}
        Example/Notation:
        \begin{example}[example or notation title]
        example or notation content
        \end{example}

    Additionally, if necessary, you can include a remark inside any of these environments using: \begin{remark}
    remark content
    \end{remark}

    Images:
    If the page includes an image, do not embed the image file. Instead, provide a description of what the image depicts.

    Text Formatting:
        Do not include any color formatting.
        For emphasis, use the \textbf command.
        Sometimes defintions are numbered, do not copy the numbers, alway try to find the relevant title, sometimes its the section

    Section Identification:
        Clearly indicate the current section and subsection within the document. For example, insert comments or plain text like “Section: [section name]” and “Subsection: [subsection name]” where appropriate.

    Output Format:
        Provide only the raw LaTeX code (from \begin{document} to \end{document} if applicable).
        Do not use markdown formatting (such as code fences) or include any extraneous text outside the LaTeX content.
        Avoid including any elements from the document header or extra structural elements (like additional section headers) unless they are part of the content inside \begin{document}.
